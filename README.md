# 11th-science-fair

All of my code that I have worked on throughout my 11th-grade STEM project will be stored here.

The "bert" folder contains attempts to use pLMs in the ProtTrans paper, hugging face site here: https://huggingface.co/Rostlab

"Other_diseases" refers to each of the individual binary classification models I made for each disease against a healthy control. The attempted (yet not very accurate) ensemble model is also there

"Other_language_models" contains my attempts at using other pLMs

"Preliminary" contains work done before December fair. It mostly pertains to CLL and COVID, there may be a few HIV cases

"Tutorials" are my attempts to follow certain tutorials for transformers and a whole variety of different architectures (so I did not personally write most of the code in that folder)

"References" contain a sanity script and a distribution of antibody lengths, not relevant but interesting thing I did once
