In sequence classification, we classify an entire protein into a category, from a list of two or more possibilities. There's no limit on the number of categories you can use, or the specific problem you choose, as long as it's something the model could in theory infer from the raw protein sequence. To keep things simple for this example, though, let's try classifying proteins by their cellular localization - given their sequence, can we predict if they're going to be found in the cytosol (the fluid inside the cell) or embedded in the cell membrane?"

The categories will just be integers, with 0 representing the first category, 1 representing the second and so on. In other words, if `sequences[i]` is a protein sequence then `labels[i]` should be its corresponding category.
